abstract = {We consider the problem of designing a dynamic scheduling strategy that takes into account both workload and memory information in the context of the parallel multifrontal factorization. The originality of our approach is that we base our estimations (work and memory) on a static optimistic scenario during the analysis phase. This scenario is then used during the factorization phase to constrain the dynamic decisions that compute fully irregular partitions in order to better balance the workload. We show that our new scheduling algorithm significantly improves both the memory behaviour and the factorization time. We give experimental results for large challenging real-life 3D problems on 64 and 128 processors.},

abstract = {Pipe corrosion is a natural phenomenon in the harsh environment of oil and gas production wells, costing billions of dollars each year. Monitoring such corrosion allows for timely mitigation to prevent leaks, environmental damage, or catastrophic failures. Corrosion of pipes is inferred from measurement of internal diameter and wall thickness. Mechanical finger calipers provide a high-resolution image of the internal pipe surface. Ultrasonic tools measure both the internal diameter and thickness of a single pipe, providing the pipe is filled with a fluid. Production tubing is a barrier to caliper, ultrasonic, and flux-leakage electromagnetic tools, preventing the assessment of outer casings. Remote-Field Eddy-Current (RFEC) tools respond to the total metal thickness of all the combined casings. The measurement is valid in single and multiple casing strings and is largely insensitive to the kind of material filling the pipe. This paper presents a new slim electromagnetic (EM) imaging tool enabling casing assessment without removing the production tubing. The tool excites eddy-currents in the tubulars using a powerful low-frequency solenoidal transmitter. Distribution and strength of the eddy-currents depend on the geometric properties of the casings, their EM properties, and the presence of defects. The tool operates in the RFEC regime using large transmitter-receiver spacings, in which the measurements directly determine the total metal thickness. Mandrel-mounted coils provide the average total metal thickness, and eighteen small pad sensors around the tool provide an image of local pipe wall metal loss. The combination of low- and high-frequency images, together with the average total metal thickness, provides a quantitative, high-resolution assessment of pipe condition. Log examples show detection of casing joints, additional casings strings, and presence of corrosion damage in the low- and high-frequency images.

abstract = {A simulation and sensitivity analysis has been performed to study the properties of a casing source excited by connecting the electrodes of a long vertical bipole antenna at the top and bottom ends of the pipe. It has been demonstrated that the casing source yields a field distribution that resembles that of the bipole antenna in an open hole. Indeed the casing current can be regarded as an attenuated version of the vertical antenna that excites the pipe. Sensitivity to the properties of finite size targets is well preserved when using the casing source. It has been demonstrated that sensitivity is higher to resistive than conductive targets. The effect of channeling current along the conductor is small, as current flows preferentially along the metallic casing. On the other hands the presence of resistive bodies yields a deviation of the current lines around the resistors which manifests strongly in the current density observed at the surface.},

abstract = {Frequency and time-domain analytical expressions are derived for the electromagnetic field response of a resistive layer inserted in an otherwise homogeneous whole-space as observed in the vicinity of an electric dipole source. The analysis of closed-form solutions demonstrated that at near-source-receiver offsets, the spectral and spatial distribution of the fields is better described by a superposition of images, associated with the dipolar character of the charges distributed in the boundaries, rather than the guided mode behavior dominating the response in the far offset regime. Approximate solutions of the fields in the frequency domain were derived using the saddle point method of integration. The formulas describing the fields were in good agreement with semianalytical calculations. However, a lower frequency bound was found, below which the expressions are inaccurate, and thereby they cannot be used to obtain time-domain solutions. A kernel modulation scheme was used instead, which yields an infinite series representation for the fields. The expressions thus derived produce accurate fields to very low frequencies, and thereby they were also used to obtain time-domain formulas. The analysis indicated that for a vertical electric dipole (VED) excitation, the late time response of the image field associated with the charge density induced on the upper boundary appears to cancel the direct field, thus providing the response of the layer. For a horizontal electric dipole (HED) source, the superimposed contributions of the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes appeared to oppose the image field, resulting in the direct field dominating over the response of the layer, and thereby masking any sensitivity to the properties of the layer in this configuration.},

Aimed at filling this gap, we analyze the contact process, i.e., the simplest propagation model, with quenched disorder on complex networks. We find Griffiths phases and other rare-region effects, leading rather generically to anomalously slow (algebraic, logarithmic, relaxation, on Erdos-R{\'{e}}nyi networks. Similar effects are predicted to exist for other topologies with a finite percolation threshold. More surprisingly, we find that Griffiths phases can also emerge in the absence of quenched disorder, as a consequence of topological heterogeneity in networks with finite topological dimension. These results have a broad spectrum of implications for propagation phenomena and other dynamical processes on networks.},

abstract = {SummaryHydraulic fracturing is an important technique to allow mobilization of hydrocarbons in tight reservoirs. Sand or ceramic proppant is pumped into the fractured reservoir to ensure fractures remain open and permeable after the hydraulic treatment. As such, the distribution of proppant is a controlling factor on where the reservoir is permeable and can be effectively drained. Methods to monitor the fracturing process, such as tiltmeters or microseismic, are not sensitive to proppant distributions in the subsurface after the fracturing treatment is complete (Cipolla and Wright, 2000).An electrically conductive proppant could create a significant physical property contrast between the propped region of the reservoir and the host rock. Electromagnetic geophysical methods can be used to image this property (Heagy and Oldenburg, 2013). However, traditional geophysical inversions are poorly constrained, requiring a-priori information to be incorporated through known electrical properties. We examine a strategy to invert directly for the proppant volume using a parametrization of electrical conductivity in terms of proppant distribution within the reservoir.},

abstract = {The electric field on the borehole axis in the pres- ence of a casing can be divided into three zones: the near, intermediate, and far zones. Within the interme- diate zone, determination of the second derivative of the potential allows me to define the formation resis- tivity. Outside the casing, the electric field, at large distances from the borehole, has a radial direction that provides a sufficient depth of investigation in this direction. The measurement requires knowledge of the casing conductance. Application of transmission line theory is based on the fact that the electric field in the formation is radial within the intermediate zone, re- sulting in the conclusion that the vertical resolution of such a measurement would depend only upon the spacing of the electrodes required to estimate the second derivative of the potential.},

Modular sensitivity computations and generic interfaces to parallelized inversion algorithms provide a ready framework for rapid implementation of new applications or inversion algorithms.

@inproceedings{Marsala2011,
abstract = {The first Borehole to Surface Electromagnetic (BSEM) pilot field survey in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was successfully executed to identify oil and water bearing reservoir layers in a carbonate oilfield water injection zone. Maximizing recovery factor by means of detailed mapping of hydrocarbon accumulations in the reservoirs is a key requirement for oil producing companies. This mapping is done routinely by accurate measurements of fluid distribution at the wells' locations, but a knowledge gap exists in the inter-well volumes, where typically only density-based measurements are available (seismic and gravity). Such technologies are not always effective to discriminate and quantify the fluids in the porous space (especially when difference in fluid densities is small, such as oil and water). On the contrary, when high electrical resistivity contrasts exist between hydrocarbons and water, electromagnetic (EM) based technologies have the potential to map the distribution of the fluids and monitor their movement during the life of the field, hundreds of meters or kilometers away from the wellbores. The objective of a BSEM survey is to obtain fluid sensitive resistivity and induced polarization maps. These are based on an acquisition grid at the surface, a few kilometers around the EM transmitting well, which reveal oil and water bearing zones in the investigated reservoir layers. In this pilot field test, BSEM showed the potential to map water-front movements in an area of about 4km from the single well surveyed, evaluate the sweep efficiency, identify bypassed/ lagged oil zones, and eventually monitor the fluid displacements, if surveys are repeated over time. The data quality of the recorded signals is highly satisfactory. Fluid distribution maps obtained with BSEM are coherent with production data measured at the wells' locations, filling the knowledge gap of the inter- wells area. Three key R{\&}D objectives for this BSEM pilot are achieved. Firstly, the capability to record at the surface EM signals generated in the reservoir, secondly, the capability of BSEM to discriminate between oil and water saturated reservoir zones, and finally obtain resistivity maps and a fluid distribution estimate plausible and coherent with the information obtained from well logs, crosswell EM, production data and reservoir models. In addition to reservoir monitoring, BSEM can be very useful in non-diagnosed areas like exploration fields for hydrocarbon exploitations.},

abstract = {We present a 3D inversion methodology for multisource time-domain electromagnetic data. The forward model consists of Maxwell's equations in time where the permeability is fixed but electrical conductivity can be highly discontinuous. The goal of the inversion is to recover the conductivity-given measurements of the electric and/or magnetic fields. The availability of matrix-factorization software and high-performance computing has allowed us to solve the 3D time domain EM problem using direct solvers. This is particularly advantageous when data from many transmitters and over many decades are available. We first formulate Maxwell's equations in terms of the magnetic field, (H) over arrow . The problem is then discretized using a finite volume technique in space and backward Euler in time. The forward operator is symmetric positive definite and a Cholesky decomposition can be performed with the work distributed over an array of processors. The forward modeling is quickly carried out using the factored operator. Time savings are considerable and they make 3D inversion of large ground or airborne data sets feasible. This is illustrated by using synthetic examples and by inverting a multisource UTEM field data set acquired at San Nicolas, which is a massive sulfide deposit in Mexico.},

@article{Oldenburg2000,
abstract = {We develop three methods to invert induced polar- ization (IP) data. The foundation for our algorithms is an assumption that the ultimate effect of chargeability is to alter the effective conductivity when current is applied. This assumption, which was first put forth by Siegel and has been routinely adopted in the literature, permits the IP responses to be numerically modeled by carrying out two forward modelings using a DC resis- tivity algorithm. The intimate connection between DC and IP data means that inversion of IP data is a two-step process. First, the DC potentials are inverted to recover a background conductivity. The distribu- tion of chargeability can then be found by using any one of the three following techniques: (1) linearizing the IP data equation and solving a linear inverse problem, (2) manipulating the conductivities obtained after performing two DC resistivity inversions, and (3) solving a nonlinear inverse problem. Our procedure for performing the inversion is to divide the earth into rectangular prisms and to assume that the conductivity and chargeability are constant in each cell. To emulate complicated earth structure we allow many cells, usually far more than there are data. The inverse problem, which has many solutions, is then solved as a problem in optimization theory. A model objective function is de- signed, and a model (either the distribution of or is sought that minimizes the objective function subject to adequately fitting the data. Generalized subspace meth- odologies are used to solve both inverse problems, and positivity constraints are included. The IP inversion procedures we design are generic and can be applied to l-D, 2-D, or 3-D earth models and with any configuration of current and potential electrodes. We illustrate our methods by inverting synthetic DC/IP data taken over a 2-D earth structure and by inverting dipole-dipole data taken in Quebec},

Tomographic data are collected over time, inverted and differenced against a background image to produce 'snapshots' revealing changes to the system; these snapshots readily provide qualitative information on the location and morphology of plumes of injected tracer, remedial amendment or stored water. In principle, geometric moments (i.e. total mass, centres of mass, spread, etc.) calculated from difference tomograms can provide further quantitative insight into the rates of advection, dispersion and mass transfer; however, recent work has shown that moments calculated from tomograms are commonly biased, as they are strongly affected by the subjective choice of regularization criteria. Conventional approaches to regularization (Tikhonov) and parametrization (image pixels) result in tomograms which are subject to artefacts such as smearing or pixel estimates taking on the sign opposite to that expected for the plume under study. Here, we demonstrate a novel parametrization for imaging plumes associated with hydrologic phenomena. Capitalizing on the mathematical analogy between moment-based descriptors of plumes and the moment-based parameters of probability distributions, we design an inverse problem that (1) is overdetermined and computationally efficient because the image is described by only a few parameters, (2) produces tomograms consistent with expected plume behaviour (e. g. changes of one sign relative to the background image), (3) yields parameter estimates that are readily interpreted for plume morphology and offer direct insight into hydrologic processes and (4) requires comparatively few data to achieve reasonable model estimates. We demonstrate the approach in a series of numerical examples based on straight-ray difference-attenuation radar monitoring of the transport of an ionic tracer, and show that the methodology outlined here is particularly effective when limited data are available.},

Capitalizing on the mathematical analogy between moment-based descriptors of plumes and the moment-based parameters of probability distributions, we design an inverse problem that (1) is overdetermined and computationally efficient because the image is described by only a few parameters, (2) produces tomograms consistent with expected plume behaviour (e. g. changes of one sign relative to the background image), (3) yields parameter estimates that are readily interpreted for plume morphology and offer direct insight into hydrologic processes and (4) requires comparatively few data to achieve reasonable model estimates. We demonstrate the approach in a series of numerical examples based on straight-ray difference-attenuation radar monitoring of the transport of an ionic tracer, and show that the methodology outlined here is particularly effective when limited data are available.},

@article{Rodi2001,
abstract = {We investigate a new algorithm for computing regularized solutions of the 2-D magnetotelluric inverse problem. The algorithm employs a nonlinear conjugate gradients (NLCG) scheme to minimize an objective function that penalizes data residuals and second spatial derivatives of resistivity. We compare this algorithm theoretically and numerically to two previous algorithms for constructing such "minimum-structure" models: the Gauss-Newton method, which solves a sequence of linearized inverse problems and has been the standard approach to nonlinear inversion in geophysics, and an algorithm due to Mackie and Madden, which solves a sequence of linearized inverse problems incompletely using a (linear) conjugate gradients technique. Numerical experiments involving synthetic and field data indicate that the two algorithms based on conjugate gradients (NLCG and Mackie-Madden) are more efficient than the Gauss-Newton algorithm in terms of both computer memory requirements and CPU time needed to find accurate solutions to problems of realistic size. This owes largely to the fact that the conjugate gradients-based algorithms avoid two computationally intensive tasks that are performed at each step of a Gauss-Newton iteration: calculation of the full Jacobian matrix of the forward modeling operator, and complete solution of a linear system on the model space. The numerical tests also show that the Mackie-Madden algorithm reduces the objective function more quickly than our new NLCG algorithm in the early stages of minimization, but NLCG is more effective in the later computations. To help understand these results, we describe the Mackie-Madden and new NLCG algorithms in detail and couch each as a special case of a more general conjugate gradients scheme for nonlinear inversion.},

abstract = {We present a technique for inverting controlled source audio‐frequency magnetotelluric (CSAMT) data to recover a 1-D conductivity structure. The earth is modeled as a set of horizontal layers with constant conductivity, and the data are apparent resistivities and phases computed from orthogonal electric and magnetic fields due to a finite dipole source. The earth model has many layers compared to the number of data points, and therefore the solution is nonunique. Among the possible solutions, we seek a model with desired character by minimizing a particular model objective function. Traditionally, CSAMT data are inverted either by using the far‐field data where magnetotelluric (MT) equations are valid or by correcting the near‐field data to an equivalent plane‐wave approximation. Here, we invert both apparent resistivity and phase data from the near‐field transition zone and the far‐field regions in the full CSAMT inversion without any correction.

The feasibility of measuring low-frequency magnetic fields through such steel-cased wells is of great interest for monitoring fluid movement during production. We report on experimental and modeling results regarding the effect of steel casing on electromagnetic signals transmitted through them. This effect includes the attenuation and phase shift of a signal diffusing through the casing wall. Sample casings are studied under low field strength in the linear regime where the casing's electrical properties are independent of the applied signals. Frequency spectra are measured for transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic polariza- tions from 0.1 Hz to 1 kHz. Numerical models, devel- oped to simulate the casing response, match the ex- perimental data very well. Finally, studies of the effects of the earth's magnetic field and casing rema- nent magnetization show that these steady biases do not affect the ac signal detection.},

@article{Yang2014,
abstract = {Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) methods are highly efficient tools for assessing the Earth's conductivity structures in a large area at low cost. However, the configuration of AEM measurements, which typically have widely distributed transmitter-receiver pairs, makes the rigorous modelling and interpretation extremely time-consuming in 3-D. Excessive overcomputing can occur when working on a large mesh covering the entire survey area and inverting all soundings in the data set. We propose two improvements. The first is to use a locally optimized mesh for each AEM sounding for the forward modelling and calculation of sensitivity. This dedicated local mesh is small with fine cells near the sounding location and coarse cells far away in accordance with EM diffusion and the geometric decay of the signals. Once the forward problem is solved on the local meshes, the sensitivity for the inversion on the global mesh is available through quick interpolation. Using local meshes for AEM forward modelling avoids unnecessary computing on fine cells on a global mesh that are far away from the sounding location. Since local meshes are highly independent, the forward modelling can be efficiently parallelized over an array of processors. The second improvement is random and dynamic down-sampling of the soundings. Each inversion iteration only uses a random subset of the soundings, and the subset is reselected for every iteration. The number of soundings in the random subset, determined by an adaptive algorithm, is tied to the degree of model regularization. This minimizes the overcomputing caused by working with redundant soundings. Our methods are compared against conventional methods and tested with a synthetic example. We also invert a field data set that was previously considered to be too large to be practically inverted in 3-D. These examples show that our methodology can dramatically reduce the processing time of 3-D inversion to a practical level without losing resolution. Any existing modelling technique can be included into our framework of mesh decoupling and adaptive sampling to accelerate large-scale 3-D EM inversions.},

This paper describes the evolution of the conceptual and technical foundations of EM methods. It outlines a framework for further development, which should focus on multitransmitter and multireceiver surveys, analogous to seismic data-acquisition systems. Important potential topics of future research efforts are in the areas of multidimensional modeling and inversion, including a new approach to the formulation and understanding of EM ﬁelds based on ﬂux and voltage representation, which corresponds well to geophysical experiments involving the measurement of voltage and ﬂux of electric and magnetic ﬁelds.},

abstract = {Floodplains play an important role in catchment hydrology, representing a zone in which groundwater is shallow, and groundwater - atmosphere interactions through evapotranspiration (ET) are more pronounced. Spatial patterns in evapotranspiration develop due to the variable distribution and type of floodplain sediments, patterns of vegetation type, floodplain elevation and geometry. Where groundwater is saline, as in the lower River Murray in South Australia, evapotranspiration concentrates salt and can lead to floodplain salinisation, vegetation dieback or health decline. Modelling these systems can assist our understanding of which areas of vegetation are at high risk from salinisation in order to target them for management. However, models of this scale require detailed data for parameter population and validation. This paper discusses the potential application of airborne, ground and “in- river” electromagnetic techniques to indicate spatial patterns of groundwater evapotranspiration and baseflow from a salinising floodplain on the lower River Murray. High resolution RESOLVE frequency domain helicopter EM data are examined along with ‘in river' NanoTEM and ground EM31 data. Their study demonstrated the scale of variations in baseflow was smaller than expected, showing alternation between losing and gaining (from a salt load perspective) groundwater in a river broadly understood to be a gaining system. The HEM and ground data sets are strongly correlated with groundwater salinity and are now being trialed as a basis for validating groundwater models.},

abstract = {The native riparian vegetation communities on the Chowilla floodplain in the lower River Murray in South Australia are suffering severe declines in health, particularly the Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. (red gum) and Eucalyptus largiflorens F.Muell. (black box) communities. The primary cause of the decline is salinisation of the floodplain soils caused by increased rates of groundwater discharge and hence increased movement of salt up into the plant root zone. The salinity is driven by a lack of flooding and rising saline groundwater tables. Rises in the naturally saline groundwater levels are due to the effects of river regulation from Lock 6 and high inflows from regional groundwater levels increased by Lake Victoria to the east. River regulation has also led to reduced frequency and duration of the floods that leach salt from the plant root zone and supply fresh water for transpiration. The frequency of medium-sized floods occurring on Chowilla has been reduced by a factor of three since locking and water extractions were commenced in the 1920s to provide reliable water for urban and agricultural use. The soil salinisation on the floodplain was modelled by using a spatial and temporal model of salt accumulation from groundwater depth, groundwater salinity, soil type and flooding frequency. The derived soil water availability index (WINDS) is used to infer vegetation health and was calibrated against current extent of vegetation health as assessed from fieldwork and satellite image analysis. The modelling work has shown that there is a severe risk to the floodplain vegetation from current flow regimes. This paper estimates that 65{\%} (5658 ha) of the 8600 ha of floodplain trees are affected by soil salinisation matching a field survey of vegetation health in 2003 (Department of Environment and Heritage 2005a), compared with 40{\%} in 1993 (Taylor et al. 1996). Model results show that the best management option for Chowilla is lowering the groundwater down to 2 m below current levels, which predicts an improvement in the health of the floodplain tree species from 35 to 42{\%}.},

abstract = {It is often argued that3Dinversion of entire airborne electromagnetic (AEM) surveys is impractical, and that1D methods provide the only viable option for quantitative interpretation. However, real geological formations are 3D by nature and 3D inversion is required to produce accurate images of the subsurface. To that end, we show that it is practical to invert entireAEMsurveys to3Dconductivitymodelswithhundredsof thousandsif not millions of elements.Thekeyto solving a3D AEM inversion problem is the application of a moving footprint approach. We have exploited the fact that the area of the footprint of an AEM system is significantly smaller than the area of an AEM survey, and developed a robust 3D inversion method that uses a moving footprint. Our implementation is based on the3Dintegral equation method for computing data and sensitivities, and uses the re-weighted regularised conjugate gradient method for minimising the objective functional. We demonstrate our methodology with the 3D inversion of AEM data acquired for salinity mapping over the Bookpurnong Irrigation District in South Australia. We have inverted 146 line km of RESOLVE data for a 3D conductivity model with {\~{}}310 000 elements in 45 min using just five processors of a multi-processor workstation.},
